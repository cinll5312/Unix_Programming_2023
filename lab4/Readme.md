## Lab Instructions
Remember we mentioned that fork copies almost everything from a parent process to its child process? This lab aims to understand how fork and stack frame works. You will need to use gdb to run and debug the challenge and read assembly codes. Your mission is to guess the number generated by our challenge server.
1. Your mission is to ask the remote challenge server to print out ** Good Job! and a FLAG stored on the server. Read the codes and think about how to solve them.

## Hints
1. buffer overflow

```bash
       |                                  |

       |  return address (64-bit)         |
